        <h1>Gratitude</h1>

        <p>As I reflect on my journey, I remember the days when i was in the deepest pits, lost in darkness and uncertainty. I constantly asked,"Why me?" Each day felt like a struggle without hope. But even when I wasn't ready to reach out, God took my hand. He held me when I couldn't hold on myself</p>
        <p>Slowly everything changed. I went from not knowing if I had a future to waking up with a purpose. My heat shifted from asking "why?" to "What's next,Lord?" Even prayers I'd forgotten about were being answered, and God never let me go of me.</p>
        <p>where I once lacked gratitude, now I give thanks. He's replaced the chaos in me with peace and order. I no longer need to justify myself, for He speaks when I can't. I'm grateful the talents He's given me, the help and support from His people, and for His constant presence. Now, I lookk forward to the future with Him</p>
