        <h1>The Phone Goes Two Ways</h1>
        <p>
           The phone goes two ways, I know this to be true.<br>
           But sometimes, Lord, I forget to reach for you.<br>
           Caught in my world, wrapped in my strife,<br>
           Dealing with the crumbling edges of my life.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My heary is heavy, my mind lost in pain.<br>
            The whispers od doubt falling like rain.<br>
            Yet, when You cross my mind, Lord, I pause and see<br>
            That maybe You're waiting , quietly, for me.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I fear I might disturb You, interrput Your grace,<br>
            So I hesitate, unsure, hiding my face.<br>
            But You , oh God always near, always close,<br>
            Reach out with love when I need it the most.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your voice is gentle, like a long-lost friend,<br>
            Calling me back, helping me mend.<br>
            So even when I falter, lost in my day,<br>
            The phone goes two ways-You remind me to pray.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I forget, though I fail to call,<br>
            You wait with open arms, catching<br>
            me when I fall.<br>
            So, Lord, when I'm wrapped in my troubles so deep,<br>
            Remind me that You're there, never asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            And when I feel like I can't find the way,<br>
            May I remember, Lord, to dial Your name and pray.
        </p>
