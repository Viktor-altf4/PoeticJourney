        <h1>God's Blessings</h1>
        <p>Hear me out:<br> 
            God doesn't benefit from us; we do.</p>
        <p>When we pray, we put trust in Him, and all our sadness, worries, and burdens are lifted. When we praise Him for being a good and merciful God, we have joy that we are able to stand before Him.</p>
        <p>Those who have served God have harvested great yields in their life because they had faith. God blessed them not just with riches but with a heart of gold. God doesn't benefit from us; we do.</p>
        <p>Surely, those of you who bring Christ to others have great faith that the Lord can do for them what He did for you. For those who struggle without Him, isn't He just so good to us? Blessed is he who trusts in Him!</p>
