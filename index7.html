        <h1>He Stood There</h1>
        <p>
            <br>He stood there,<br>
            not with thunder in His voice<br>
            not lighting in His eyes, <br>
            but with the silence<br>
            that settles storms.<br>

            <br>He did not rush in
            <br>to fix what broke
            <br>but sat beside it
            <br>like a friend
            <br>who doesn't fear the fragments.<br>

            <br>His robe gathered dust
            <br>from the roads I wandered,
            <br>His hands bore stories<br>
            <br>of holdong hearts
            <br>without letting go.<br>

            <br>He asked me nothing,
            <br>but knew everything-
            <br>not the version I rehearsed,
            <br>but the trembling me
            <br>beneath the masks.<br>

            <br>And still,
            <br>He stayed.
            <br>Not to shame me
            <br>not to scold the dark,
            <br>and whisper:
            <br>"I'm not leaving."
        </p>
