        <h1>Would You Pray for Me? PT.2</h1>
        <p>
            If your soul is slumped and silent now,<br>
            I'll sit with you where shadows bow.<br>
            If you can't walk, I'll kneel and pray—<br>
            A whispered faith to light your way.
        </p>
        <p>
           When words pour out and won't make sense,<br>
           I'll be the calm, the strong, the fence.<br>
           When silence screams more loud than cries,<br>
           I'll stay—no questions, just reply.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your faith is flickering low,<br>
            I'll guard the flame until it grows.<br>
            Read with you, hold you, give you space,<br>
            And wrap your ache in quiet grace.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need to earn this care,<br>
            It's love that meets you broken there.<br>
            You want to rest, and you don't know how—<br>
            But even that is holy now.
        </p>
        <p>
           So breathe. Or sigh. Or speak. Or wait.<br>
           This pain is seen. It's not too late.<br>
           For help. For hope. For gentle hands.<br>
           For grace that understands.
        </p>
