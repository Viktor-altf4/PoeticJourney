        <h1>Would You Pray For Me?</h1>
        <p>
           Would you pray for me,<br>
           If I said I was down for the count?<br>
           Would you hold me,<br>
           When I can't even hold myself?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Would you lift me up,<br>
            When my legs forget how to stand<br>
            Would you listen,<br>
            When the words won't stop spilling out?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Would you sit in silence with me,<br>
            When all I need is your presence?<br>
            Would you kneel beside me,<br>
            When I can't pray on my own?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Can you lend me your faith,<br>
            Because mine is worn and weak?<br>
            Read with me, talk to me,<br>
            Hug me—and just be here.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To be held…<br>
            That's all I need right now.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I need help.<br>
            I need rest.<br>
            I need strength.
        </p>
         <p>
           But I'm too proud to ask.<br>
           I want to rest,<br>
           But I don't know how.<br>
           I need hope—<br>
           Just enough<br>
           To keep going.
        </p>
