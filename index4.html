        <h1>Dear God</h1>
        <p>
            <br>Dear God, I'm scared, I'm terrified,  
            Some days I want to run and hide,  
            But firm I stand in what You've said,  
            I come back running, not misled.<br>

            <br>When I sin, I fear Your dismay,  
            Afraid You'd turn Your love away,  
            But that's not true, You welcome me,  
            With open arms, You set me free.<br>

            <br>For doubts I have, You bring to ruin,  
            And in Your grace, I'm found again,  
            I want to grow, to walk in love,  
            Need You more than the air above.<br>

            <br>God, I need You, every day,  
            In every step, in every way,  
            With gratitude, my heart does sing,  
            Thankful for everything You bring.
